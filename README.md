## Proposal

One prediction of climate change is that the intensity and rainfall
rates of cyclones will increase\[1\]. Also expected to increase are the
damages and costs of such storms. In the U.S., hurricanes Florence,
Harvey, and Michael serve as the most recent examples.

The devastating effects of these events are demonstrated starkly via the
use of satellite imagery both before and after they occur. For example,
this Washington Post
[graphic](https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2018/world/amp-stories/before-and-after-images-of-typhoon-yutu-destruction/)
shows the destruction brought by Super Typhoon Yutu.

Recently, efforts have been made to use such imagery as means for
automated damage detection in storm-effected areas\[2\]\[3\]. I propose
using and building on these existing methodologies to assess
storm-damaged areas and linking this information to estimates of
localized monetary damages. This would provide a novel approach for
predicting the costs of future storms.
